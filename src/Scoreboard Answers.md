**Question 1:** In terms of the mantra, describe the tests you need to verify the correctness of a *non-full* `Scoreboard` with more than two entries.  Be specific about how many tests you need.

The tests I would need to verify the correctness of a *non-full* `Scoreboard` with more than two entries would involve adding an additional score per test and comparing it with the positions of the previously added scores. 

**Question 2:** In terms of the mantra, describe the tests you need to verify the corrections of a *full* `Scoreboard`.  Be speicific about how many tests you need.  *HINT*: Think carefully about the "bottom" of the `Scoreboard`.

You only need one test to see if the full scoreboard works. Within the test you need to fill up the scoreboard and then confirm that everything is in the correct place, then you need to add an additonal score and determine if it is in the right place, and then make sure you list is only limited to the amount of scores that you wanted to put in in the begining.
