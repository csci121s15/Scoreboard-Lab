1. You would need to test that if the first score is smaller than the second (which we just did), and then when adding a third value, that if the third value is greater than the score at position 1 (second place), but is less than the score in position 0 (first place), that it replaces position 1, bumps second place to third place, but does not affect first place.
2. When the scoreboard is full, we would need to ensure that scores that are not high enough would not make it into the scoreboard and that any scores that do qualify to be in the scoreboard would take the appropriate position and bump all of the scores below it down to the next position and bump out the score in the last position on the scoreboard. So in total, we should have seven tests in the testing class.
