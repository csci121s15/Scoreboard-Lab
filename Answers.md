# Scoreboard lab

**Question 1:** First, a new instance of ```Scoreboard``` is created with a length of 10 and one score. Then a second and third score are added to ```scores```. There are four tests needed to check this instance of ```Scoreboard```. Verify that the number of scores is three, that it's less than ```maxCount```, and that the scores are in proper order by testing the first and last score in ```scores```.

**Question 2:** An instance of Scoreboard is created with a length of 10 and has 10 scores. Add an aditional score to ```scores```. Verify the full scoreboard using four tests. Check that the scores are sorted by checking the first and last scores, test if the last score added is in the expected location in ```scores```, and test if the number of scores remaining is still 10.
