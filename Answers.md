## Scoreboard Lab

**Question 1:** With more than one score being entered, it would be necessary to first create the scoreboard, input values of scores, then check that all the scores entered exist in `Scoreboard` as well as checking if they appear in the correct order. There should be 3 tests then, one adding them in accending order, one in decreasing order, and one in a mixed order.

**Question 2:** In order to test the corrections of a full scoreboard, we must create a scoreboard with a certain max size. We then must add scores until the scoreboard is full, and also passed. Then we must check to see that only the highest scores stay. We must also check to see that there aren't more scores in `Scoreboard` than specified as the maximum amount of enteries. There will need to be 4 tests, one for accending order of scores, one for a decending order, one for neither accending or decending, and one for multiple of the same score entries.
