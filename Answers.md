**Scoreboard Lab Answers**

**Question 1**
Because you have more than one score being entered you need to check all the scores being entered with the other scores in ``Scoreboard`` and make sure they are in the correct order. You need a test to make sure they are first in increasing, and then decreasing order.


**Question 2**
We need to make a ``Scoreboard`` with the max amount of scores and then add scores to see if they pass. We need a test to check the scores in increasing, decreasing, and a full set of scores.
