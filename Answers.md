# Scoreboard Lab
### John Vonelli

**Question 1**:  In terms of the mantra, you would need to have the three tests in the `ScoreboardTest` class to ensure of the correct positions of each value.  For example, you would need to have to check whether the scoreboard is empty, and whether the previous score is bigger than the new one and vice versa.

**Question 2**:  In terms of the mantra, you would need to make another testing class called 'ScoreboardTestFull'.  From there, you would need to follow very close to the previous 'ScoreboardTest'testing class.  We would need to create each similar test to pass at first, and then we would need to slowly build the Scoreboard class and progressively test each method we fix to make sure that it is correct.  From there, we would make sure that all tests approve of this.
