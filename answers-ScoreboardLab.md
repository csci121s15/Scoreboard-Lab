***Question 1:***
There must be a test that verifies that the high score is in the `[0]` index of the `scores` array list. There also must be verification that the scores are sorting themselves from largest to smallest value. 

***Question 2:***
A full scoreboard test includes adding the same amount of scores as the maximum amount able to be held in the scoreboard itself.
