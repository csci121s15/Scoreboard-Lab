>**Question 1:** In terms of the mantra, describe the tests you need to verify the correctness of a non-full SCOREBOARD with more than two entries.  Be specific about how many tests you need.

**Answer 1:** The test we would need for a non full scoreboard is testMultipleScoresNonFull. This would give us a total of three tests.  We need to use the bubble skip.  Make the number from the right go to the left if it's greater than the number to the left of it.

>**Question 2:**  In terms of the mantra, describe the test you need to verify the corrections of a full SCOREBOARD.  Be specific aobut how many tests you need.  HINT: Think carefully about the "bottom" of the SCOREBOARD.

**Answer 2:** The test we would need for a non full scoreboard is testMultipleScoresFull. This would give us a total of four tests.
