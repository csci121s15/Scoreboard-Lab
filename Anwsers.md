**Question 1:** We need to test that the scores added are placed in the correct positions based on the other scores in the Scoreboard. You will only need one test to test any number of scored beyond 2.

**Question 2:** A number of scores greater than the total spaces available in the scoreboard must be added in the test to be sure that the scoreboard correctly removes scores that are pushed out of the scoreboard's max size.  The scores that are added should be in all in all random orders to be sure that the addScore function is placing the new scores in the correct positions in the scoreboard.
